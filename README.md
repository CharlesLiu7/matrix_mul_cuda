# Matrix Mul using CUDA

OS: Win10
IDE: VS2013

## matrixMul

The code show how to use CUDA to execute vectors add operation.

## matrixMul_demo

The code use two ways to calculate matrix.

- one thread compute one result of matrix_c
- use grid

## matrixMul_grid

The offical CUDA code use grid to compute matrix.

## test

The environment is very essential, refer to http://www.hongweipeng.com/index.php/archives/288/

Use CABLAS lib. very very fast!!!
