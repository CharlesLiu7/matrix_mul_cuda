# Matrix Mul using CUDA

## matrixMul

The code show how to use CUDA to execute vectors add operation.

## matrixMul_demo

The code use two ways to calculate matrix.

- one thread compute one result of matrix_c
- use grid

## matrixMul_grid

The offical CUDA code use grid to compute matrix.

## test

Use CABLAS lib. very very fast!!!
